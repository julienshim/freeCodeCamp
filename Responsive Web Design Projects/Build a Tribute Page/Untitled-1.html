                <h2>About &sdot; Oskar Barnack </h2>
                <p>Oskar Barnack (1979-1936) was a German optical engineer, precision mechanic, industrial designer and father of
                    35mm photography. Very little is known about his personal life. Most of the information about his life revolves
                    around his career at Ernst Leitz (now known as Leica Camera) where he designed the Ur-Leica, a prototype 35mm
                    camera which was developed into the Leica range of viewfinder cameras and further developed into the Leica
                    range of Leica Screw Mount rangefinders.</p>

                        <p>"Barnack’s ingenious invention set fourth new eras in photography, setting new standards for photographic
                            equipment, amateur photographers, art photographers and photojournalists. Leica’s mystique was almost
                            instantaneous; the Leica 35mm camera was the single most influential camera, and it was the most
                            imitated."</p>
